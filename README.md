## **Features**

### **Excisting features**

#### **Features relevant to all pages**

##### **Header**

Contains the logo and navigation bar and is located at the top of every page where the user would expect them to be. The logo and navigation bar together give the user the name of the site and where different information can be found. The header provides links to all pages of the site to easily navigate between them. The logo is a link to the home page and the navigation bar links to the other pages; Classes and Sign up.  

The links turn pink or blue when hovering over them, indicating to the user that the object is clickable.

##### **Footer**

The footer is located at the bottom of every page. It contains icons with links to external social media pages where more information that is interesting to the user can be found. It has therefore been given a bright blue color to make it stand out from background color of the rest of the site, to be easily found and to not be forgotten.

The links are opened in a new tab, so that the user can stay on the Studio dancers site.

#### **Home page**

##### **Introduction section**

This section aims to give the user a warm welcome to make them interested and continue exploring the page. This is done with a happy image and inspirationala and selling words. Words that I want the user to focus on are highlighted with pink and blue color. 

The image has been placed to the left to make it appear directly under the logo and navigation bar on smaller screens.

##### **About us section**

The About us-section provides the user a little bit more detailed information about what Studio dancers offers and what users can expect if they sign up for a class. Directly below the information a link is provided to the schedule for the dance classes, so that the user can reach it fast and easy without having to go to the navigation bar again. The link is highlighted in pink and changes to white when hovering over it.

The purpose of the thank you-page is simply to ensure the user that the form has been sent and inform them that the studio will contact them. It only contains a few short sentences, to not keep the user at this page longer than necessary.
